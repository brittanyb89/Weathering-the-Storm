# Weathering-the-Storm

## Description

Developer created this weather application to assist travelers in finding the current weather for their searched city and the 5-day forecast. The goal is to grab weather data and put it in one convenient location so that user could search and get all the weather information they need for a total of 5 days. This solves the problem of traveling and not knowing what the to pack on your trip and possible flights delays due to weather, etc. I learned that API service is used to pull various information from a network and put it in one place for optimal usage.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

User would type their desired city into the search box and the weather for that city would appear in the current section and in the 5-day forecast section. Previous search history would be stored in the local storage and shown below the search box to quickly access later if needed.
